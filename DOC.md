# Introduction
This model uses XGBOOST to predict whether an employee would quit a company using features like estimated salary,tenure etc. and obtains mean accuracy of using K-Fold Cross Validation

XGBoost is one of the most popular machine learning algorithm these days. Regardless of the type of prediction task at hand; regression or classification.
XGBoost is well known to provide better solutions than other machine learning algorithms. In fact, since its inception, it has become the "state-of-the-art‚Äù machine learning algorithm to deal with structured data.

## Boosting

Boosting is a sequential technique which works on the principle of an ensemble. It combines a set of weak learners and delivers improved prediction accuracy. At any instant t, the model outcomes are weighed based on the outcomes of previous instant t-1. The outcomes predicted correctly are given a lower weight and the ones miss-classified are weighted higher.
